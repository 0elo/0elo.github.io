Hello reader, welcome to Zero Elo, my blog to document every aspect
of my coding journey! My objective with this blog is to make my own
observations about the activities that I'm currently working on, primarily
for memory retention and being able to deftly describe the technical work
I'm doing.

For starters, here's a quick blurb about me. I currently work as a Software
Quality Engineer at a large defense contractor in Boston, MA. My primary roles involve
reviewing source code and systems requirements and developing a Python software
package to automate a verification process across multiple programs. As for
education, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Engineering and will be
pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science through [Georgia Institute of Technology's
OMSCS program](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/). On my own time, I generally tinker
with random Python libraries and focus on improving my Python skills and general
computer science knowledge. My current endeavors are establishing a foundation
in machine learning, learning the Django framework, and an unnamed Unity game to
be released on Android. Not all of my life is spent immersed in a screen though; I'm
an avid tennis fan and enjoy scouring the city for splendiferous food.

I hope to be able to blog frequently. At the moment, my plan is to post at least
once a week. For now, I hope this was a sufficient introduction.
