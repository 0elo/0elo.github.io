I am a Software Quality Engineer working for a large defense contractor, and slated to start my studies for a M.S. in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology's OMSCS program in August 2018. In my spare time, I tinker with Python and Unity. If I'm not staring at a screen, I can generally be found at the nearest tennis court.
